## Introduction

Drupal 8 Context condition plugin that inspects a node's `field_pid` for the presence of a registered Islandora 7.x namespace.

Note that this repo is a temporary home until this plugin is included in the base Islandora module, is packaged in its own module, etc. See the discussion at https://github.com/Islandora-CLAW/CLAW/issues/396 for more detail.
